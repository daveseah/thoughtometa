### WHAT IS THOUGHTOMETA

Thoughtometa is intended to be a personal "knowledge creation and publication system", to eventually replace my current blog running Wordpress. 

The system has a set of source files ("the knowledge") with a classification hierarchy embedded in the front matter (YML) that can be referred to in the content (Github-flavored Markdown) or by the processing system. These source files are stored in a hierarchical directory structure and are transformed by the processing system into finished HTML files and indexes.

My goal is to have a minimally-distracting writing environment that helps me research topics of interest and publish the works-in-progress as a public laboratory notebook viewable on the Internet. The purpose of this public notebook is to be a resource not only for people interested in what I'm doing, but in cataloging a wide range of reusable bits of knowledge that people can use in their own interest-driven studies. I want the system to also make it easy to cross-reference, remix, and extend existing chunks of knowledge. 

How to do this is a mystery to me. I'm planning on building the system on NodeJS, gulp, git, and Metalsmith, as these are tools that I am growing more familiar with in my other work.
